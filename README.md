# SAMD51_InterruptTimer

Atmel SAMD51 interrupt service routine timer library for e.g. Adafruit M4 Metro/Feather/ItsyBitsy Express.

Method names mimic the 'ZeroTimer' library by Tamasa (@EHbtj) for easily switching compilation between SAMD21 and SAMD51 microprocessor boards.
See https://github.com/EHbtj/ZeroTimer for the SAMD21 library.
