# SAMD51_InterruptTimer

Interrupt service routine timer library for an Atmel SAMD51 microprocessor board, like e.g. Adafruit M4 Metro/Feather/ItsyBitsy Express. Only offers the use of clock TC3. This library can be used in the Arduino IDE.

Method names mimic the 'ZeroTimer' library by Tamasa (@EHbtj) for easily switching compilation between SAMD21 and SAMD51 microprocessor boards.
See https://github.com/EHbtj/ZeroTimer for the SAMD21 library.
